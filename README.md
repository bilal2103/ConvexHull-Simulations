# Geometric Algorithms' Simulations
This project shows the implementation and visualization of Geometric Algorithms with various Big Oh complexities. User input of various number of points in the 2D plane is taken to achieve the results. The program allows
users to interactively simulate the working of each step of the algorithms, which are created and tested using python libraries and displayed on Tkinter canvases. The
scope of our project is limited to Convex Hull and Line Segment Intersection algorithms. Line segment intersection methods used are: Orientation method and Franklin Antonio’s method. These algorithms determine
whether two given line segments intersect or not. Meanwhile, convex hull algorithms used are: Brute Force, Jarvis March, Graham Scan, Quick Elimination and Chan’s algorithm. These methods are responsible for 
determining the smallest convex polygon encompassing a set of points.
